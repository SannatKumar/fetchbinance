# Description

This script scraps the detail information as per need from the api provided by Binance.


# File missing

The config file is missing from the script.

Basically it contains confidential information like apiKey and apiSecret.

You can create a file named config.py, and paste the following and save it in the same folder as your main file(fetchbin.py).

apiKey = "Your Binance apiKey"
apiSecurity= "Your Binance Secret Key"
